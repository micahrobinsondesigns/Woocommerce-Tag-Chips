# Woocommerce Tag Chips
This plugin creates the ability to add custom "chips" for product pages using WooCommerce Product Tags. Every product that is tagged will display the customized chip associated with it. In the example below I created a tag "Clearance" and added the chip text "Clearance Item" to display.

To add color to the chip or the text of the chip simply type in either the an HTML color name, or paste in a hex color code. The # at the beginning of the hex will be generated automatically depending on what you type in the form fields.
